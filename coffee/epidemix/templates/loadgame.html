      Earth is being attacked by space viruses send by
      the Xutr-Gaad alien race.
      <br>
      <br>
      These viruses have been known to cause an epidemic
      known as Epidemic X or simply EpidemiX. 
      <br>
      <br>
      The first outbreaks have been contained but a continuous
      flow of viruses is thrown towards Earth,
      to prepare the ground for an invasion.
      <br>
      <br>
      If humans are to survive and fight back, the Epidemix must
      be destroyed before it reaches the atmosphere...
