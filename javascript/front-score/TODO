Provide routes for libraries/scripts/sites, in list and single mode
Add a search bar that is visible on lists and searches for inputed string
    (new search route, searches for everything and returns matches (name only))
Add pagination options (10,20,50,100) and custom offset
add backend that simply proxies requests (if they seem correct and they come
from the same domain)

Test and document everything
